##HTML

###Syntax

HTML that is indented is readable HTML. You can use either tabs or spaces to indent - be consistent with what you use in your markup.

###Commenting code
Commenting is a good idea - it can help remind you why you used the code you did and also add some structure between blocks of markup.

###Things to do
To keep a record of things that you want to work on, prefix comments with TODO

###DOCTYPE
Use HTML5 for all work

###Validation of code
If you choose to validate your code, you can do so using the [W3C Validator](http://validator.w3.org/).
If your HTML is not working as you were expecting it to, check for invalid markup by using the W3C validator.
