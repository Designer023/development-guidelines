As projects evolve and adapt there needs to be a consistent method for keeping the code in a state where  adding or removing features/sections or update core themes/layouts with as little effort and side effect as possible.\r\n\r\nAs such the following is necessary:\r\n\r\n- Code need to be maintainable and readable\r\n- Code needs to be modular and transportable/transferable\r\n- Code needs to be scalable\r\n- New starters need a strict set of guidelines to work to and be held to so that there is no creep in the styling\r\n\r\nThis should apply across all our technologies used, but in this scope it will focus on just the stylesheets, HTML and Javascript. \r\n\r\n\f\r\n##CSS\r\n###CSS writing style\r\nThere are a few ways of writing that can be used\r\n\r\n**Yes**\r\n\r\n    .hyphen-separated {...}\r\n\r\n**No**\r\n\r\n    .camelCase {...}\r\n    .underscore_separated {...}\r\n    .alllowercase {...}\r\n    .ALLUPPERCASE {...}\r\n\r\n###Specificity\r\n\r\nDon’t be specific If you have more than 3 nested classes then it’s too specific! This is hard to override for other classes and will bloat the css. \r\n\r\n**Yes**\r\n\r\n    .my-thing { … }\r\n    .my-main-thing .my-thing { … }\r\n    .my-main-thing .my-space .my-thing { … }\r\n\r\n**No**\r\n\r\n    .my-main-thing .my-sub-thing .my-space .my-thing { … }\r\n\r\nNEVER hook styles onto an #ID...EVER. It’s too specific http://cssguidelin.es/#ids-in-css. You can still use an #ID for hooking javascript but styles can’t be attached.\r\n\r\n**Yes**\r\n\r\n    .my-thing { … }\r\n\r\n**No**\r\n\r\n    #my-thing { … }\r\n\r\n!important is only ok for some things like error messages that always display in one way and have to show in red bold. We don’t have a !superimportant so if you have to use !important to override something else then the something else is too specific to start with. Go back and unspecify the other code, please don’t add more specificity. It’s hard to override an !important for a reason and it’s meant to be used to make sure a rule works as it should. It’s not a fix for overriding something that is broken. \r\n\r\n**Yes**\r\n\r\n    .hidden { display: none !important; }\r\n    .error { color: red !important; }\r\n\r\n**No**\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t/* as a group of rules */\r\n\t\t.my-thing { color: red  }\r\n    .my-thing { color: blue !important; }\r\n\r\n###Commenting your code\r\n\r\n- If you have to think about it then it should be commented.\r\n- If it’s over a screen length then you probably should provide comments to note the code so it can be navigated. If it’s very long then think about adding an index.\r\n- There’s no such thing as too many comments (probably)\r\n- There’s nothing wrong with a bit of humor in a comment, but don’t make if offensive! People can read the CSS publicly.\r\n\r\n###CSS methodologies\r\n\r\n####FLAT\r\n\r\nThere is no overall structure to the css. This is ok on small sites/microsites. \r\n\r\n\r\n####BEM\r\nhttp://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/\r\n\r\nA block consist of elements such as headers, search bars, primary navigation, widgets, list panels etc. Basically anything that can be a stand alone item. The block should be named something sensible and relevant but not a stupidly long name like .this-is-the-block-where-the-results-sit-in. try something like .events-list assuming there is no other event list blocks. If there is then make it a little more specific so there is no name clash!\r\n\r\nThe elements within the block should all be prefixed with the block name followed by a double underscore and any html selectors are nested in the css if they are not explicitly named.\r\n\r\nThe block\r\n\r\n    .block-name {...}\r\n \r\nSpecific items within the block\r\n\r\n    .block-name__title {...}\r\n    .block-name__more-info {...}\r\n\r\nGeneric items within the block are ok not to have a class on\r\n\r\n    .block-name p {...}\r\n    .block-name ul li {...}\r\n    .block-name span {...}\r\n\r\nTry to nest no more that 3 levels, preferably 2, so if you have a .block-name ul li a span either give the spans a .block-name__some-class and style that or drop the li a out of the selector.\r\n\r\nGlobal styles\r\n\r\nIf there are any global styles that needs to be used in many blocks use a prefix of .global__. Using a close button as an example:\r\n\r\n**Global item**\r\n\r\n    .global__button-close\r\n\r\n**Block item**\r\n\r\n    .block-name__button-close\r\n\r\nIt might mean a few more classes on things but it should keep them all unique so we don't getting any clashes as blocks get moves/updated over time etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n####OOCSS\r\nI don’t know about this. yet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###State names\r\n \r\n    .is-active {...}\r\n    .is-disabled {...}\r\n    .has-error {...}\r\n\r\nThese are used only to define the state of an object. They should be prefixed with .is- or .has-. \r\n\r\nThese should never be styled as a stand alone classes as is as they always are tied to an element or module. The state classes should be wrapped within the module or element:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Yes**\r\n\r\n    .my-module__item.is-active { display: block; }\r\n    .btn.is-disabled { color: grey; }\r\n    .form.has-error { border: 1px solid red; }\r\n    .has-error .form { border: 1px solid red; }\r\n\r\n**No**\r\n\r\n    .is-active { display: block; }\r\n    .is-disabled { color: grey; }\r\n    .has-error { border: 1px solid red; }\r\n\r\n###Utility classes\r\n\r\nUtility classes are used for more global styling. Ideally they should be prefixed with .u- to denote what they are for, but since there are only a few it’s acceptable to have it without the .u-. \r\n\r\n**Yes**\r\n\r\n    .u-right { … }\r\n    .u-left { … }\r\n    .u-clearfix { … }\r\n\r\n**Yeah, ok too**\r\n\r\n    .right { … }\r\n    .left { … }\r\n    .clearfix { … }\r\n\r\n####Javascript hooks\r\n\r\nThese should NEVER BE USED FOR STYLES. You can apply styles to a class that is added via javascript, but anything that is for js to hook onto MUST NOT HAVE STYLES RELATED TO THE CLASS.\r\n\r\n    <span class=”js-menu-toggle”>Menu</span>\r\n    <ul class=”js-menu-target is-active”>...I’m a menu</ul>\r\n\r\nThe javascript should add/remove the .is-active class and that should be styled. The .js-menu-target is only for the javascript.\f\r\n\r\n##Sass\r\nSass makes some of the above easier. It automates the tedious\r\n\r\n##Javascript\r\n\r\n##HTML\r\n\r\n##Development setups\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways that \r\n\r\n###Gulp\r\n###Grunt\r\n###Codekit\r\n\r\n\r\n##Frameworks\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple only common frameworks are used, however these should be used with caution as everyone is not as experienced with these\r\n\r\n- Bootstrap\r\n- Foundation \r\n\r\n##REFERENCE\r\n\r\n###CSS guidelines:\r\n\r\nhttp://cssguidelin.es/\f\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
