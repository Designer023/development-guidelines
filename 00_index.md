#Code Best Practices

##Introduction

We have a large number of designers and developers working on a range of projects. As projects evolve and adapt, there needs to be a consistent method for keeping the code in a state where adding or removing features/sections or updating core themes/layouts is straightforward.

So, code needs to be:

- readable
- maintainable
- scalable
- modular and transportable/transferable

Guidelines for coding standards will ensure that these standards are maintained, and giving you more thinking time about fun new stuff :)

This guide will cover all technologies and methodolgies that should be used, and also provide principles that are used to make decisions.
