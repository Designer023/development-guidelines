#Code Best Practices

##Introduction

We have a large number of designers and developers working on a range of projects. As projects evolve and adapt there needs to be a consistent method for keeping the code in a state where adding or removing features/sections or update core themes/layouts with as little effort and side effect as possible.

As such the following is necessary:


- Code need to be maintainable and readable
- Code needs to be modular and transportable/transferable
- Code needs to be scalable
- New starters need a strict set of guidelines to work to and be held to so that there is no creep in the styling

This will cover all technologies and methodolgies that are used, but the principals should apply to other topics that aren't covered here.

Please read the about page for instructions on how to update this documenation.
